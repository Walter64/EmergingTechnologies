## Emerging Technologies
### Repository for Emerging Technologies Module

### Author: Walter Regan, B.Sc.in Software Development

### Instructions
The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that you have achieved the learning outcomes
of the module while also providing you with sample work to show prospective employers.
<b />
The overall assessment is split into the three components as detailed below.
The percentages beside each bullet point indicate the weighting of that item in your
overall mark. Note, however, that the examiners’ overall impression of your submission
may override the individual weightings where deemed appropriate.
<b />

#### GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks – these are described further down.
<b />
**The repository should contain the following:**
10% A clear and informative README.md explaining:<b />
*Why the repository exists*
<b />
*What is in it*
<b />
## How to run Notebooks
1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [Cmder](https://cmder.net/), if on windows. It is portable console emulator for Windows.

### To run scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
1. Download [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). ????
2. Run 'juypter lab' from the cmder console - must be in project folder

### To run quantum-deutsche Jupyter Notebook
1. Download []().
2. Run 'juypter lab' from the cmder console - must be in project folder

<b />
10% A Dockerfile and/or a docker-compose.yml file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration.
You should also include any other required files, such as a requirements.txt file, data files, and image files.
<b />

### About Cmder
Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.

### Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
**Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.**
10% A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
<b />
20% Demonstrations of at **least three interesting scikit-learn algorithms.**
You may choose these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise.
Note that the demonstrations are at your discretion – you may choose to have an overall spread of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.
10% Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.
<b />

### Quantum Computing Jupyter Notebook
**Include a Jupyter notebook called quantum-deutsch.ipynb that contains the following.**
15% A clear and concise comparison of **quantum computing and classical computing**.
25% An explanation of **Deutsch’s algorithm and code simulating it using qiskit**.
